### Hi there, I'm Alok Kulkarni! 👋

I'm a results-driven procurement analyst with a strong track record in assessing production needs, developing precise specifications, and ensuring timely material delivery. I am proficient in inventory management, procurement reporting, and cross-functional collaboration. My strong communication and organizational skills have enabled me to drive organizational success.

🔭 Currently, I am a Procurement Analyst at Weber Manufacturing Technologies Inc., where I manage procurement activities and have successfully acquired materials and equipment worth $13 million within a year. I have also developed and implemented an inventory system to maintain optimal stock levels, expedited the delivery of raw materials, and generated procurement reports for management and stakeholders.

🌱 I have a Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics from Seneca College, where I studied the impact of Big Data and statistics on business scenarios. I have hands-on experience with tools like SAS, Tableau, and SAS Enterprise Miner, and I have applied my learnings to various college projects involving predictive analytics and text mining.

💼 Previously, I worked as a Customer Service Representative at Walmart Canada, providing exceptional customer service, resolving complaints, and promoting new products and services. I also have experience as a Manufacturing Engineer at Forbes Marshall, where I implemented process improvements, led cross-functional teams, and implemented quality control measures.

🎓 I hold a Post Graduate Diploma in Supply Chain Management-Global from Conestoga College, where I gained insights into supply chain decisions and contributed to efficient production and customer fulfillment. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mumbai. I worked on projects such as manufacturing and testing an F1 race car and developing a Universal Test Rig for bike engines.

🏆 I take pride in my achievements and have been honoured with the President's Honor List at Seneca College in April 2021.
